## How It Works

After running the program, the user can choose from the menu options to add, search, display, or delete student records.

The program stores records temporarily while it is running. Once the program is closed, the records are not saved permanently.

## Future Improvements

- Add file handling to save and load student records
- Add an option to update existing student records
- Add sorting by student ID or name
- Add case-insensitive search
- Improve the user interface
- Organize the program using classes
